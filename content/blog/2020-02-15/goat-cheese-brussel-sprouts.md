Now, I know you are most likely skeptical of this recipe, and you only clicked on it to check what crazy non-sense of a recipe it is, but trust me, this recipe is actually delicious. My parents were skeptical, Joy Joy (my grandma) was skeptical, but after the first bite...they took many more. Though it may seem like an unlikely pair, blueberry and bacon actually go really well together. The sweetness of the blueberries, brightened by the lemon cuts through the salty dominance of the bacon and makes room for the goat cheese and brussel sprouts to shine through. That may be hard to imagine, so you mind as well go try it yourself.

As for tips, I have a couple. First, when making the incision into the brussel sprouts, don't be too timid. Make it deeper in the center and really try to open it up so it will be easier to stuff the goat cheese in there. Second, I would let the garlic sit in the goat cheese over night if you have the forsight to plan this. It infuses the garlic flavor a lot more and allows for the garlic to be heard more clearly over the punchy flavors in the final bite. Third, I am afraid a piping back of some sort is basically required to get the goat cheese anywhere near the center of the brussel sprout. A plastic bag with the tip cut off will work just fine if you are gentle and the goat cheese is relatively warm. Lastly, frozen berries work just as well for the blueberry sauce as fresh do, so don't bother spending a fortune on the fresh ones :).

Finally, I want to note that for this recipe, it is not so much the individual pieces that are unique, but rather the combination of a couple recipes. I have posted the recipes I used as inspiration below, so feel free to reference them as their descriptions most likely be more detailed than mine.

Anyway, this is a great conversation and dinner party starter, so I hope you will give it a whirl in the new year.

Enjoy!

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Mince the garlic and combine in a small bowl with the goat cheese. Place in a small plastic bag (or whatever you will use to pipe the cheese into the brussel sprouts.) Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. While you are waiting for it to boil, trim and clean the brussel sprouts.</li>
        <li>Put the brussel sprouts in the boiling water for 2 min, then remove immediately and place in a bowl, strainer, or on a plate to dry.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Once the brussel sprouts are cool, and mostly dry, use a small pairing knife to make an "X" on the top of each. This X sould span most of the top and be deeper in the center than on the sides. By doing it this way, you will have an easier place to put the cheese, but it won't all come falling out the sides.</li>
        <li>Cut a small hole in one corner of the bag with the goat cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the corner of the bag with the hole in the middle of each brussel sprout and squeeze gently to fill.</li>
        <li>Wrap each brussel sprout with a piece of bacon (length or cross-wise is fine), and place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 - 30 min (or until the bacon is crispy), flipping halfway through.</li>
        <li>While the brussel sprouts are baking, make the blueberry sauce. First, combine lemon juice, sugar, and cornstarch in a medium sauce pan and stir until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the water and blueberrys to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 - 5 min.</li>
        <li>Once the brussel sprouts are cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the accompanying sauce. Enjoy!</li>
