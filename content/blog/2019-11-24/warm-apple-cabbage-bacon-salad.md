The dishes that come out of Joy Joy's (my grandma) kitchen have always been fascinating
to me. They combine ingredients in unusual ways that, (for the most part) are unexpectedly delicious. Though I would like to say she thoroughly plans out the ingredients and the balance of flavors, this is certainly not the case. More often, she simply looks into her fridge, sees what is there, and then starts to cook. This recipe is a result of that very technique, and without her creative brain I would not be able to share it with you, so thanks Joy Joy.

A few tips for this recipe. First, I would recommend using a Pink Lady apple or some other apple that has a nice, punchy flavor. Pink Ladies also tend to be a firm apple so they will remain slightly crisp when saut√©d. Second, I would recommend baking the potato whole and then removing the skin and adding it to the pan. I baked the potato in cubes in the oven the second time I made this recipe and they didn't combine with the cabbage and goat milk yogurt as well.

The final tip is so important that it deserves its own paragraph. It is: Serve with some form of pickle. The best is a pickled carrot (which I will be posting my recipe for soon), but I think other pickles would work as well (though admittedly I have not tried them.)

Anyway, good luck and bon appetit!
