The the dishes that come out of Joy Joy's (my grandma) kitchen have always been fascinating 
to me. They combine ingredients in unusual ways, that (for the most part) are unexpectedly delicious. Though I would like to say she thorouly plans out the ingredients and the balance of flavors, this is certainly not the case. More often, she simply looks into her fridge, sees what is there, and then starts to cook. This recipe is a result of that very technique, and without her creative brain I would not be able to share it with you, so thanks Joy Joy.

A few tips for this recipe. First, I would recommend using a Pink Lady apple or some other apple that has a nice, punchy flavor. Pink Ladies also tend to be a firm apple so they will remain slightly crisp when sautéd. Second, I would recommend baking the potato whole and then removing the skin and adding it to the pan. I baked the potato in cubes in the oven the second time I made this recipe and they didn't combine with the cabbage and goat milk yogurt as well. 

The final tip is so important that it deserves its own paragraph. It is: Serve with some form of pickle. The best is a pickled carrot (which I will be posting my recipe for soon), but I think other pickles would work as well (though admittedly I have not tried them.)

Anyway, good luck and bon appetit!

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Rub all sides of the potato with olive oil</li>
            <li>Poke the potato with a fork a few times on each side to create air holes.</li>
            <li>Bake potato on baking sheet until a fork slides through easily - about 50 to 60 min - flipping every 20 min</li>
            <li>Place the bacon slices in a large fry pan and cook to desired doneness. When the bacon is done, remove from the pan and set aside for later.</li>
            <li>While the bacon is cooking, peel the wilted or dirty outer leaves of cabbage off so you are left with the fresh center.</li>
            <li>Chop the stem end off the cabbage, then cut in half length-wise.</li>
            <li>Slice each half into 1/4 inch strips and set aside for later.</li>
            <li>Chop the apple into 1/2 inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Once the bacon is out of the pan, add the cabbage and apple to the fry pan and sauté on medium heat for 10 to 15 min or until the cabbage is mostly wilted.</li>
            <li>Once the cabbage is soft, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and add the goat yogurt and baked potato to the pan.</li>
            <li>Sauté for an additional 2 - 3 minutes or until all the ingredients are warmed through.</li>
            <li>Chop bacon slices and pickled carrots (if using), sprinkle on top, and serve.</li>
