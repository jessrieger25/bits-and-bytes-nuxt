  "ingredients": [
    "1 Small Head Savoy Cabbage or 2 Small Heads Red Cabbage",
    "1 Large Baking Potato",
    "1 Red Apple (preferably Pink Lady)",
    "1 tsp Olive O",
    "1 C Goat Milk Yogurt",
    "Salt and Pepper",
    "4 or 5 Thick Slices of Bacon",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.",
    "Rub all sides of the potato with olive oil.",
    "Poke the potato with a fork a few times on each side to create air holes.",
    "Bake potato on baking sheet until a fork slides through easily - about 50 to 60 min - flipping every 20 min",
    "Place the bacon slices in a large fry pan and cook to desired doneness. When the bacon is done, remove from the pan and set aside for later.",
    "While the bacon is cooking, peel the wilted or dirty outer leaves of cabbage off so you are left with the fresh center.",
    "Chop the stem end off the cabbage, then cut in half length-wise.",
    "Slice each half into 1/4 inch strips and set aside for later.",
    "Chop the apple into 1/2 inch pieces.",
    "Once the bacon is out of the pan, add the cabbage and apple to the fry pan and saute on medium heat for 10 to 15 min or until the cabbage is mostly wilted and only has a slight crunch left.",
    "Sprinkle the cabbage with salt and pepper then add the goat yogurt and baked potato to the pan.",
    "Saute for an additional 2 - 3 minutes or until all the ingredients are warmed through.",
    "Chop bacon slices and pickled carrots (if using), sprinkle them on top, and serve."
