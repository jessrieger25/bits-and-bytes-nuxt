    "Place the bacon slices in a small skillet on medium heat and cook until they reach the desired crispness. Remove from the heat and place on a paper towel on a plate.",
    "Slice the Brie into 8 thin slices. Cut 4 slices of tomato, about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick.",
    "Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit, and slice each half.",
    "Cut (or tear) the english muffins in half. Place them on a baking sheet.",
    "Put the muffins in the oven and turn the broiler to high.",

    "Remove the muffins from the oven. Remove the tops of the muffins from the pan and set aside. Place 2 slices of Brie on each of the bottoms (or however much you want) and return to the broiler. Watch the muffins closely, and remove once the cheese has completely melted.",
    "Top muffin bottoms with 1/4 of the avocado slices, a tomato slice, and 2 pieces of bacon, and the muffin top.",
    "Take a huge bite of the sandwich because you just can't wait for it to be on the table :)"
