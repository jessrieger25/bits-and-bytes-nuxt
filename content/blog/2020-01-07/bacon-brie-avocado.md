There is truly nothing better than a good old-fashioned sandwich. This may be one of the most delicious things I have ever made, and the best part about it is that it is extremely simple! In a way, it is a spin off of the classic BLT, but I would almost argue that this one is better. The creaminess of the cheese and the avocado mixed with the salty bacon is incredible and something everyone should try at least once.  
In terms of recommendations, I would encourage you to melt the cheese on the bread in the oven before you make the sandwich. If you set the oven to broil and watch it closely you can get the perfect melted cheese and nicely toasted bread. As well, I would not skimp on the cheese. My rule of thumb is always the more cheese the better. Furthermore, though this recipe is not truly one of my originals, I did make some adjustments that I highly suggest. First off, use an english muffin instead of normal bread. I bought the sandwich size ones and they worked perfectly. Another good option is always the classic french baguette, which is just as tasty with this sandwich. Finally, I did add tomato to it, which tasted really good and made it a bit lighter. Anyway, there is really no way to mess this sandwich up though so it is bound to be tasty no matter what you do.

I hope you enjoy this delectable creation as much as I did! Good luck!
