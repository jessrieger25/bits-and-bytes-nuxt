Before my adventures at the farmer's market in Syracuse, I had never heard
of, much less tried, a ground cherry. What is more, if it were not for some random man pulling me over to a stand at the market and telling me to try one, I probably would have never picked one up.

I am sure many of you are wondering what a ground cherry is, so I will do my best to describe them. Ground cherries are small, yellow balls that look like a mini cherry tomato. They taste like a very sweet cherry tomato with a hint of a flavor I can not describe. Personally, I do not enjoy eating them raw, though some people certainly. do. Instead, I prefer to make them into jam. By making them into jam, their sweeter notes are brought to life, and the almost earthy, tomato taste fades to the background, thus adding depth of flavor without being overpowering.

In terms of the actual recipe, I have written it according to my preference, however, it is very flexible. If you like the ground cherries without lemon, feel free to leave it out, or if the jam is too tart for you, you can always add a little white sugar during the last 5 minutes of simmering to sweeten it up. Mostly, I just hope you are able to find ground cherries in a local store and give this recipe a try.

Enjoy!
