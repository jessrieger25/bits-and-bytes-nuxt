I could eat this salad for days (and actually in perfecting the pictures and the recipe itself, I did!) It is a perfect way to make salads appropriate for dinner in the winter with its warmth and filling nature. The dressing is great because the spice level can be adjusted to preference, and the roasted veggies are low maintenance. In my opinion it is an easy thing to whip up (even on a week night.)

As for tips, there are always a few. First, I would highly recommend putting a touch of oil on your measuring spoon before measuring out the honey. This will make it much easier to get off. Second, if you have the time, I would roast the garlic cloves for the dressing (skin and all) with the vegetables until they become soft. This will add depth of flavor to the dresssing and make the garlic flavor more aparent. Third, feel free to adjust which vegetables go in this salad. The veggetables listed are my preferred ones, but potatoes or carrots would also be good. Lastly, the recipe for the dressing says red wine vinegar, but if you don't have that in the house, white wine or rice wine vinegar will also work.
