Alright so this is definitely one of my favorite recipes. As per usual, it was shown to me by my Co-Chef/Aunt Eileen.  It is certainly one of the best banana bread recipes that I have ever had.  It is moist, flavorful, sweet, and crispy all at the same time.  The only down side to this recipe is that you have to do everything in a particular way.  No matter how many times my mother tries to make the bread and skip the steps I tell her, it never turns out quite as well.

The key to this recipe is to put the bananas in the cuisinart/food processor until they are completely liquid. Though you may think that you can just mash the bananas with a fork for the same effect, that is not true. My mother has tried to skip this step a few times and the bread just never comes out the same. I think that the cuisinart mashing gives the bananas an airy quality that is not there when they are mashed with a fork. Regardless, sometimes after you mash them in the cuisinart, you may have to mash the parts that the cuisinart does not get by hand with a fork or spatula, or whatever utensil you choose.

I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I do, and don't get frustrated if it doesn't work perfectly the first time!
