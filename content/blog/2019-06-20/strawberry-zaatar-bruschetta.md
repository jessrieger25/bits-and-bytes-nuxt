Not sure exactly where I came up with this recipe, but boy am I glad that I did. These 
light and vibrant brushcetta are a great way to start a dinner party. The sweetness of the 
honey compliments the salty, herb forward za'atar and the sour/sweet zing of the strawberries and the tang of the goat cheese to create waves of different flavors and in your mouth. One moment you might taste the tang of the goat cheese and the next you will find the sweet relief of the honey.

Another great thing about this recipe is that the flavor combination is really the central point, not the
actual form that it is served in. For example, if you are gluten free, you could transform the elements of the brushcetta into a salad.

Though this post seems short, that is really all that needs to be said. I hope the picture and this
description has enticed you, and that you will give it a try! Enjoy!
