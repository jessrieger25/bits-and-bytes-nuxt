This burger was the first totally original recipe that I came up with, so consequently I am very partial to it. The inspiration for this burger was my annoyance with the existing world of veggie burgers. Every time I would go out to eat, particularly to a brewery where I would expect to enjoy a rather heavy beer, I would want a veggie burger. However, my stomach is slightly intolerant to black beans, and thus I could never eat the veggie buggers that were served. So, I decided to make my own instead. I wanted something light, filling, and spicy, and this is what I came up with. For those of you who are veggie burger consumers, you will know that veggie buggers served at restaurants commonly lack texture as well, so I tried to add that with the onions and arugula on top.

Tips for this recipe are as follows: 1. Do not be afraid of spicy mayo, embrace it and be sure to make it with a little kick at least. 2. Do not put too much cinnamon in the patty as it can easily overwhelm. 3. This recipe recommends using english muffins, so be sure to make your patties slighly smaller than a typical burger bun size otherwise you might have some overflow :).

Enjoy!
