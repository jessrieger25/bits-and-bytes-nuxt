What can be said about one particular variety of chicken recipe or another that
has not yet been said. I am not sure. All I know is that this recipe is tasty and,
in my opinion, worth making as a way to spice up the different ways you prepare
chicken throughout the week. As well, the stuffed nature of the chicken allows
you to make any quality of chicken (destined to be dry, or wonderfully tender and juicy) into the same moist and tender finished product. And if it does turn out dry, well then you have the butter sauce and the za'atar punch to come to the rescue. What is more, as basically a goat cheese (or rather cheese in general) addict, I am always looking for a new way to integrate cheese into my dinners.

Some tips for this recipe are as follows. First, When the chicken is stuffed and cooking, be sure to put at least 1 toothpick (if not more) through the open side to help it remain closed. This will help the goat cheese mixture stay inside as the chicken cooks and changes shape. Second, if you have the foresight and time, I would combine the garlic and goat cheese for the stuffing mixture the night before you make the chicken. This will allow the garlic to infuse into the goat cheese and present itself as a much more aparent flavor in the final product. Additionally, this recipe will state to put the skillet in the oven to finish off the chicken, but if you don't have an oven proof skillet, a casserole dish will work. As well, the recommended internal temperature for cooked chicken is 165 degrees F, but I have never been able to get my chicken to this temperature, and yet my chicken was PLENTY done. I think the stuffing affects the temperature reading in some way, so I usually aim for 150 to 155. Finally though skin on chicken breasts is desirable for this recipe, the skin is not totally necessary. You will not get as much browning on your final product without the skin and the chicken may dry out a bit more, but the chicken will still be tasty in the end.

Good luck, and enjoy!
