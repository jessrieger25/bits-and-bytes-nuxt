What can be said about one particular variety of chicken recipe or another that
has not yet been said. I am not sure. All I know is that this recipe is tasty and, 
in my opinion, worth making as a way to spice up the different ways you prepare 
chicken throughout the week. As well, the stuffed nature of the chicken allows 
you to make any quality of chicken (destined to be dry, or wonderfully tender and juicy) into the same moist and tender finished product.  And if it does turn out dry, well then you have the butter sauce and the za'atar punch to come to the rescue. What is more, as basically a goat cheese (or rather cheese in general) addict, I am always looking for a new way to integrate cheese into my dinners. 

Some tips for this recipe are as follows. First, When the chicken is stuffed and cooking, be sure to put at least 1 toothpick (if not more) through the open side to help it remain closed. This will help the goat cheese mixture stay inside as the chicken cooks and changes shape. Second, if you have the foresight and time, I would combine the garlic and goat cheese for the stuffing mixture the night before you make the chicken. This will allow the garlic to infuse into the goat cheese and present itself as a much more aparent flavor in the final product. Additionally, this recipe will state to put the skillet in the oven to finish off the chicken, but if you don't have an oven proof skillet, a casserole dish will work. As well, the recommended internal temperature for cooked chicken is 165 degrees F, but I have never been able to get my chicken to this temperature, and yet my chicken was PLENTY done. I think the stuffing affects the temperature reading in some way, so I usually aim for 150 to 155. Finally though skin on chicken breasts is desirable for this recipe, the skin is not totally necessary. You will not get as much browning on your final product without the skin and the chicken may dry out a bit more, but the chicken will still be tasty in the end. 

Good luck, and enjoy!

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>With a paring knife, make a pocket in the thin side of each chicken breast. The pocket should start and end about an inch from each end of the chicken breast and go almost all the way through the breast horizonally.</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg in a bowl and then add the parsley, goat cheese, za'atar, shallot, and lemon zest. Mix that until it is combined, place in a plastic bag, and cut one corner of the plastic bag so that it resembles a piping bag. I like to make the hole about a half inch wide since the mixture is rather thick.</li>
            <li>Pipe the stuffing into the chicken breasts. The mixture is sticky, so you may have to resort to using your hands.</li>
            <li>To help the chicken stay closed as it cooks, you can optionally use toothpicks to keep the pocket closed by sticking the toothpick through the two sides of the open pocket.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 T olive oil in a large skillet.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts in the skillet skin side down and cook until the skin turns golden brown, usually about 10 min.</li>
            <li>If your skillet is oven-proof, flip the breasts, place the skillet in the oven, and bake for an additional 8 to 10 minutes or until the chicken reaches 165 degrees F. If your skillet is not oven proof, flip the chicken breasts and place them into a casserole dish and bake until 160 - 165 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the oven, place the chicken on a serving platter and reheat the skillet on low heat. </li>
            <li>Add the butter, white wine, and remaining lemon juice to the skillet and allow to simmer for 2 - 3 min. Once finished, drizzle the sauce on top of the chicken, and sprinkle with a tad of fresh lemon juice if you wish.</li>
        </ul>
