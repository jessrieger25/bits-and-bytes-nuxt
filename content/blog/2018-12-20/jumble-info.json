  "ingredients": [
    "4 oz. Unsweetened Baker's Chocolate",
    "3 Egg Yolks",

  "instructions": [
    "Boil a small saucepan of water.",
    "Combine the chocolate (chopped) and the shortening in a metal mixing bowl with a round bottom.",
    "Place the mixing bowl over the boiling water, making sure the water doesn\u2019t touch the bottom of the bowl, and stir until the shortening and chocolate are completely melted.",
    "Then add the molasses, hot water, vanilla, and egg yolks (beaten.)",
    "In a separate bowl, combine all the dry ingredients except the sugar.",

    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "Flour a counter surface, and roll the dough out about 1/4 inch thick.",

    "Finally, place the cookies on a baking sheet and bake until puffy.  It should be about 7-10 min.  Be mindful that the cookies will harden as they cool so they should not be hard when you take them out.",
