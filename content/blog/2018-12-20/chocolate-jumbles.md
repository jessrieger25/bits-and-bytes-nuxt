At the Rieger house it would not be Christmas without a few Chocolate Jumbles to finish off the meal. These cookies are a classic that my Grandma has made for years. This year though, I made a few myself and they actually turned out better than expected! Regardless, my grandmother is still the master of these cookies. I am just passing along the fantastic recipe (and a few of her very own tips.)

For this recipe, there are definitely a few adjustments that improve the results (and your mood after making these cookies) significantly. First, the recipe calls for 1 cup of crisco shortening. This can be a little tricky to get out of the can that it usually comes in, so it is better to buy the sticks that are already measured out. Second, the recipe calls for hot tap water. The water does not have to be boiling hot, it just needs to feel warm to the touch. Next, the recipe says to beat the eggs, however my grandmother just beats the yolks with a fork. Fourth, when you are rolling the dough out to make the cookies, you should not roll them too thin otherwise they will fall apart when you are transferring them. I would say the cookies should be about 1/4 inch thick (and better a bit thick rather than too thin). As well, when you are rolling out the dough, do not be afraid of using a healthy sprinkle of flour as the dough can be rather sticky.

The last tip requires its own paragraph because it is difficult to explain. The bae time for these cookies varies a lot based on the oven and how dry you like your cookies. The rule of thumb with cake-like cookies is that they should bounce back when you touch them. However, I found that with these cookies, if you don't take them out until this is true, they will be overcooked. In my oven, the cookies baked for about 7 minutes, and when I took them out they were still soft. They will seem underdone when you take them out, but they will harden as they cool. I would recommend doing a test batch of 1 or two cookies to see how long they take in your oven. For the test batch, be sure to wait until they cool to check the texture,as it changes a lot during cooling.

Anyway, I know you won't be dissappointed if you give these cookies a try because they are incredibly delicious!
