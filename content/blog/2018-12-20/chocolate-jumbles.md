At the Rieger house it would not be Christmas without a few Chocolate Jumbles to finish off the meal.  These cookies are a classic that my Grandma has made for years.  This year though, I made a few myself and they actually turned out better than expected! Regardless, my grandmother is still the master of these cookies. I am just passing along the fantastic recipe (and a few of her very own tips.) 

For this recipe, there are definitely a few adjustments that improve the results (and your mood after making these cookies) significantly.  First, the recipe calls for 1 cup of crisco shortening.  This can be a little tricky to get out of the can that it usually comes in, so it is better to buy the sticks that are already measured out.  Second, the recipe calls for hot tap water. The water does not have to be boiling hot, it just needs to feel warm to the touch.  Next, the recipe says to beat the eggs, however my grandmother just beats the yolks with a fork. Fourth, when you are rolling the dough out to make the cookies, you should not roll them too thin otherwise they will fall apart when you are transferring them.  I would say the cookies should be about 1/4 inch thick (and better a bit thick rather than too thin). As well, when you are rolling out the dough, do not be afraid of using a healthy sprinkle of flour as the dough can be rather sticky.

The last tip requires its own paragraph because it is difficult to explain. The bae time for these cookies varies a lot based on the oven and how dry you like your cookies.  The rule of thumb with cake-like cookies is that they should bounce back when you touch them. However, I found that with these cookies, if you don't take them out until this is true, they will be overcooked.  In my oven, the cookies baked for about 7 minutes, and when I took them out they were still soft.  They will seem underdone when you take them out, but they will harden as they cool. I would recommend doing a test batch of 1 or two cookies to see how long they take in your oven. For the test batch, be sure to wait until they cool to check the texture,as it changes a lot during cooling.

Anyway, I know you won't be dissappointed if you give these cookies a try because they are incredibly delicious!

        <h3>Cookie Instructions</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>Boil a small saucepan of water.</li>
          <li>Combine the chocolate (chopped) and the shortening in a metal mixing bowl with a round bottom.</li>
          <li>Place the mixing bowl over the boiling water, making sure the water doesn’t touch the bottom of the bowl, and stir until the shortening and chocolate are completely melted.</li>
          <li>Then add the molasses, hot water, vanilla, and egg yolks (beaten.)</li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, combine all the dry ingredients except the sugar.</li>
          <li>Then add the dry ingredients and the sugar to the first (wet) mixture slowly, beating well.</li>
          <li>Let the dough cool in the refrigerator for about an hour.</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
          <li>Flour a counter surface, and roll the dough out about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
          <li>Cut out doughnut shaped cookies. If you don’t have a doughnut cutter, you can use a normal round cookie cutter and then just use a separate cutter to make the hole in the center.</li>
          <li>Finally, place the cookies on a baking sheet and bake until puffy.  It should be about 7-10 min.  Be mindful that the cookies will harden as they cool so they should not be hard when you take them out.</li>
          <li>Make the frosting according to the recipe below.</li>
          <li>Once the cookies have cooled, frost them.</li>
