If you have ever come in contact with my family, I am almost certain that you have tried one of my mother's famous Chocolate Chip Cookies.  For years I have wanted to help her make them, but she would never let me, because as she claims, '(she) has a system.'  However the other day, she finally let me help, so now I can attempt to give you one of my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipes of all time.

Before continuing, I warn you, these cookies are very hard to master.  Several people have tried to make them exactly as my mother does, but none have really nailed them. I don't know what it is, whether its our oven, or simply the way she mixes them, but there is something magical about her touch that makes them utterly delicious in a way no one else's are.

This recipe is certainly not one of the easiest, so you will just have to bear with me as I try my best to explain to you what exactly you must do. As well, you should note, that there are 2 different versions of this recipe; one for summer and one for winter.  Though it may sound crazy, my mother swears it makes a difference.  Below, I have attached only the summer recipe.  Lastly, for this recipe you really must use a baking stone.  You could try it on an oiled baking sheet, but there is just something about a stone that makes the cookies turn out best.

Anyway, after all of these warnings, I hope I have not scared you off and that you will take a chance and try this recipe.  Even if they don't turn out perfect, these cookies are still delicious.  Good luck and happy baking!

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>Add 2 sticks of refrigerated butter to the kitchen Aid mixer bowl and beat on low until itâ€™s just a little mushed.  Roughly 30 sec.</li>
          <li>Add brown sugar and white sugar, then cover with hands while beating on high until med/small clumps form.</li>
          <li>Take the bowl out from under the kitchen aid and using a rice spoon/paddle mash the clumps of butter against the side of the bowl until most of them are broken up and gone.</li>
