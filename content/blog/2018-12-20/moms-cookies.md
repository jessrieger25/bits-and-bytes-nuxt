If you have ever come in contact with my family, I am almost certain that you have tried one of my mother's famous Chocolate Chip Cookies.  For years I have wanted to help her make them, but she would never let me because, as she claims, '(she) has a system.'  However the other day, she finally let me help, so now I can attempt to give you one of my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipes of all time.

Before continuing, I warn you, these cookies are very hard to master. Several people have tried to make them exactly as my mother does, but none have really nailed them. I don't know what it is, whether it's our oven, or simply the way she mixes them, but there is something magical about her touch that makes them utterly delicious in a way no one else's are.

This recipe is certainly not one of the easiest, so you will just have to bear with me as I try my best to explain to you what exactly you must do. As well, you should note, that there are 2 different versions of this recipe; one for summer and one for winter. Though it may sound crazy, my mother swears it makes a difference. Below, I have attached only the summer recipe. Lastly, for this recipe you really must use a baking stone. You could try it on an oiled baking sheet, but there is just something about a stone that makes the cookies turn out best.

Anyway, after all of these warnings, I hope I have not scared you off and that you will take a chance and try this recipe. Even if they don't turn out perfect, these cookies are still delicious. Good luck and happy baking!
