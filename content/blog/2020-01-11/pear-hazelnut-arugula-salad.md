This recipe is a gift from my friend Trevan Signorelli, and if I am not
mistaken, it is actually from his grandmother. Either way, I came about 
this recipe as we wandered aimlessly around Wegmans. Having made too many 
new recipes that week, I was flat out of ideas, so I told Trevan to pick something. This recipe is what he pulled out of his hat, and it was perfect
for our evening. It is simple, delicious, light, but filling. 

For the most part, I would just tailor this recipe to your own preferences. Use the recipe as a starting point for the flavor combination, and then go off script. However, as always, I do have a couple tips. First, if you like the dressing on the sweeter side, I would add equal parts honey and apple cider vinegar. Second, if you feel like the dressing could use something more, or you want it to be a more consistent texture, I would throw a bit of Dijon mustard in and whisk. This will emulsify the dressing and allow it to stay together. Lastly, as you are shopping for the hazelnuts, DO NOT get chopped. Though they will taste ok, they are not nearly as tasty once roasted as the whole hazelnuts are. 

P.S Trevan and I disagree on the use of mustard with the dressing, hence the reason it is optional. Both are good though, so try them and make your own opinion :).

Bon Appetit!
