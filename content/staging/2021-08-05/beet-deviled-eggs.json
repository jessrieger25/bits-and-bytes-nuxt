  "ingredients": [
    "4 Large Eggs",
    "2 Medium or small beets",
    "2 - 3 Tsp Honey",
    "2 - 3 Tsp Mustard",
    "Pinch of Cayenne",
    "1 Tbsp Olive Oil",
    "Salt and pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 375F.",
    "Peel the beets and dice them into 1/2 inch pieces. Place on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper.",
    "Put the eggs in a small saucepan with enough water to cover.",
    "Bring to a boil, and let cook for 9 minutes. When they are finished, remove from the water and place in ice water to cool.",
    "Once the oven is preheated, push all the beets together on the baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, spread the beets out on the baking sheet and cook for an additional 5 minutes - or until easily pierced with a fork.",
    "Put the beets in a food processor or blender and pulse until the beets become a smooth paste.",
    "Peel the eggs carefully and slice in half. Then, scoop out the egg yolks gently and add them to the beets.",
    "Add 1.5 tsp of honey and mustard to the beets with a pinch of cayenne. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Taste the mixture and adjust the honey/mustard/cayenne ratio to taste.",
    "Once the mixture is perfect, use it to fill the egg whites, adding about 1.5 Tbsp to each. If you are going for presentation on this dish, be careful not to touch the egg white with the beets as they stain easily.",
    "Enjoy!"
