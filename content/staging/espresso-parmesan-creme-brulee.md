As some of you may know, interesting flavor combos are my favortie things to test out. I love to play with the different ways of using the ingredients and see what I can come up with. So here goes my latest one, Parmesan and Coffee.

Initially, not the easiest flavor combo to use I will admit. The trickiest part was that many of the usages of coffee are sweet and those of parmesan are savory, so finding the middle ground was interesting. In my initial brainstorm I had options on both sides of the aisle, but the one that intrigued me most was the creme brulée. Mind you, prior to this endeavor I had never made a creme brulée before, so that alone was putting this idea in danger of failing.

Nevertheless, from the parents and grandmother's (admittedly biased) reactions, I think it turned out alright. The creme brulée provides the sweet base with aromatic and almost bitter notes from the espresso powder. When topped with the parmesan, the salty sharp tang comes through to round out the otherwise light flavors and the salt it provides enhances all the notes present.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Preheat the oven. 300°F for gratin dishes, 325°F for ramekins or custard cups. </li>
          <li>For this recipe, use 4 individual gratin dishes, or six 4-ounce ramekins (do NOT use larger ones).</li>
          <li>Place dishes on a high-rimmed baking sheet or in a roasting pan large enough to contain all of them.</li>
          <li>Combine the cream, milk, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan and warm on medium heat until the sugar and salt dissove (about 1-2 minutes).</li>
          <li>In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks.</li>
          <li>Slowly add the cream to the egg yolks in a slow stream while whisking gently and being careful not to create any foam.</li>
          <li>Stir in the liqueur and espresso, then transfer mixture to a container with a spout for easy pouring (seriously, don't skip this.)</li>
          <li>Divide the mixture evenly among the dishes. If you are using larger ramekins then is recommended - use more ramekins and fill them less, otherwise you will be waiting all day for them to bake.</li>
          <li>
          Place the pan containing the custards n the oven rack and fill the pan with enough water to reach at least half way up the sides of the dish. If you are using gratin dishes, bake for 20 - 25 minutes or until just set. If you are using ramekins, snugly cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. When the pan is jiggled they should just barely quiver. NOTE: these times are sometimes inaccurate. They are the recommended times per normal creme brulée however in my oven the baking took quite a bit longer.   </li>
          <li>
            Once baked, carefully remove the dishes from the pan    using a metal spatula or tongs (and on oven mitt for support) and set them on a cooling rack. Let the custards cool to room temperature. Then loosely cover and refrigerate overnight.
          </li>
          <li>When ready to serve, top all the custards with about 1.5 teaspoons of parmesan. Then cover the parmesan with 2 tsps granulated sugar (or enough to coat the surface).</li>
          <li>Then use a blow torch to melt the top until it forms a solid layer and is a nice golden brown. You can also use the broiler BUT you must watch each custard like a hawk as they burn extremly fast.</li>
          <li>Serve with a spoonful of the topping mixture on each.</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>

        <h3>Topping Ingredients</h3>

        <h3>Topping Instructions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Place oats, brown sugar, grated parmesan and a dash of salt in a bowl and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Put the egg white in a bowl and whisk vigorously until foamy. You really want to break up the jello-like texture and make it more into a normal liquid.</li>
            <li>Add the egg to the other ingredients and mix to combine.</li>
          <li>Dump ingredients onto a rimmed baking sheet and spread out into a moderately thin layer.</li>
          <li>Heat the broiler on high.</li>
          <li>Once ready - be sure a rack is in the top most rung for baking. Place the baking sheet on the top rack and broil. DO NOT walk away while broiling. Broil for 30 second increments and then use a spatula to flip/stir the mixture. As you approach the level of toastiness that you desire (usually a bit darker than a golden brown) be more and more careful with how long you let the mixture broil without checking. This is going to be a VERY annoying process, but I promise its worth it.</li>
