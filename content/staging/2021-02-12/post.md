Are you a fan of Cheez-Its? Do you ever wish there were another flavor to
counter some of that monotonous constant cheese/salt flavor? Well then its likely
you will enjoy these parmesan apple chips. They are crunchy and munchable, making them a
great snack, and they have the perfect fruity tang to complement the cheese. Admittedly, they
are a bit more work then opening a box of crackers, but in my opinion, they are worth it.

During the development of this recipe I played around with many different flavor toppings, namely
cheddar, allspice, ground ginger, maple syrup, cinnamon, etc. But in the end, the parmesan was my favorite.
However, if you decide to play around with your own toppings, I would love to hear about it!
