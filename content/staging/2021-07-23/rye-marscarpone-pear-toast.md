This idea came to me as I was standing in front of a lack-luster but interesting bread shelf at a middle eastern
grocery store. There was country bread, pita, and this insanely dark rye bread with all combinations of seasonings and
dried fruit. Because the rye bread was different, and intriguing, I absolutely had to buy it. There was no other option.
Plus, it would probably be the easier thing to use than the seaweed salad I was also purchasing.

Anyway, this toast is very subtle. When you eat it, you should breathe through your nose and think about what you are
tasting, otherwise you will miss it. The warm but sour notes of the rye bring out the tanginess of the marscarpone, and the
sweetness of the pears and honey balances it out. The nuts are there for a bit of texture, but they also offer a reprieve from the fatty/sweet notes. Be careful as you make this one, for it is easy to overdo it with the honey and feel like you are
eating honeycomb.

One last tip, it really matters what rye bread you have and the seasonings in it. I would go for a gentle rye but if you are in a punchy mood then a dark rye works as well (you just might need a sweeter pear :) ). Either way, good luck and email me with comments/thoughts!
