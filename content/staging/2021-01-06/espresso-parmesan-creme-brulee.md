As some of you may know, interesting flavor combos are my favortie things to test out. I love to play with the different ways of using the ingredients and see what I can come up with. So here goes my latest one, Parmesan and Coffee.

Initially, not the easiest flavor combo to use I will admit. The trickiest part was that many of the usages of coffee are sweet and those of parmesan are savory, so finding the middle ground was interesting. In my initial brainstorm I had options on both sides of the aisle, but the one that intrigued me most was the creme brulée. Mind you, prior to this endeavor I had never made a creme brulée before, so that alone was putting this idea in danger of failing.

Nevertheless, from the parents and grandmother's (admittedly biased) reactions, I think it turned out alright. The creme brulée provides the sweet base with aromatic and almost bitter notes from the espresso powder. When topped with the parmesan, the salty sharp tang comes through to round out the otherwise light flavors and the salt it provides enhances all the notes present.
