        to be added to the subscribers list and get weekly emails about updates
        on the blogs, and occasionally a bit of sass and humor.

      <h3>The Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        My first food blog (and the one that many of my subscribers followed me
        from) was called The Gourmet College Chef. It was aimed at making
        recipes seem simpler and more accessible than they might in a recipe
        book, but most of the time I just posted whatever I enjoyed eating for
        the week or felt like making. Though I did post classics and simple
        recipes occasionally, for the most part, the foodie side of me took the
        reins and dove into more difficult recipes. Regardless, it was a good
        first attempt, and I learned a lot about how to write recipes, how to
        manage a blog, and how to hide subscriber lists so that a robot can't
        get all the emails. However, I did not particularly enjoy using the
        Weebly platform to manage my blog, and I felt as though I was just
        posting recipes that others had created, so I decided to make a change.
      </p>
      <h3>Bits and Bytes</h3>
      <p>
        For those of you still lost on the pun of the name of my blog, it is
        supposed to represent bits of food knowledge mixed with the fact that
        this website was developed in-house (or apartment I suppose) by your's
        truly. Using Weebly just felt a bit wrong as a Computer Science Major in
        college. Thus, if you have any styling suggestions, or problems with the
        website, please feel free to email me at
        <a href="mailto:thegourmetcollegechef@gmail.com"
          >thegourmetcollegechef@gmail.com </a
        >. Anyway, with this blog, I hope to share recipes that I create and/or
        are shared with me by friends and family. I hope to open my readers eyes
        to new flavor combinations and most of all, provide them with a tasty
        meal. Enjoy!
